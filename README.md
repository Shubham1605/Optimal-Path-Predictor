# Optimal-Path-Predictor
This Project suggests the paths optimized on various parameters which includes Distance,Cost,Traffic as per user choice.
Explicit node selection between source and destination is ensured.Scenic Places are suggested if lies in the proximity of path
that is being suggested.The complete project is developed on C.
The Proximity images would be shown only when images are stored in bgi folder.So store any 24-bmp image to check.since this project uses C graphics it works on Turbo-C only.
Algorithms used-Dijkstra , A-star
